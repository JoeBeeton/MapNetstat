# MapNetstat
Displays connections between your machine and remote systems. If the remote system is on the public internet, it's location is shown on a Map
## Prerequisites
Java 1.8+
Windows ( Currently )
At the moment windows is the only supported OS. This is due to the fact that there is no straight Java way of getting the list of processes and ports. So this has to be done by calling native commands on the OS.

## Usage
run the command java -jar mapnetstat.jar
